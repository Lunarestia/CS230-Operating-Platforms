# CS230-Operating-Platforms
Java program edited and completed for my CS230-Operating Platforms Java Course.

The client was The Gaming Room. The software they wanted made was a game called Draw It or Lose It. It is created for Android systems and they wanted to add cross-platform functionality. 

I was able to go through and add the functions that were requested, using the FIXME comments as a guide.

I cannot think of any areas that can be improved on, I feel I met the requirements pretty well.

I looked at the needs that were listed in the request and researched ways to accomplish them, taking into account cost effectiveness and user friendliness. Ensuring the client's needs are met is important when creating softwre for any client as this ensures their happiness and thus improves my reputation as a programmer. This will show subsequent clients that I am able to listen to their needs and meet them to the best of my ability.

My approach was to look at each file and check for errors. Once ensuring each error was corrected, I ran the software to ensure it ran as expected. This knowledge can be helpful in the future, when working with code written by someone else that needs the bugs worked out.
